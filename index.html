<h1>ReInk</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p><strong>ReInk</strong> - is <em>experimental</em> utility to reset ink level in new chiped <em>Epson</em>
 cartridges programmatically through regular printer interface (i.e. without 
 any additional hardware controllers).</p>
<p>This utility is supposed to be an Open Source alternative to Windows program named 
<a href="http://www.ssclg.com/epsone.shtml">"SSC Service Utility"</a>.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<p>To find out features of current ReInk version look at the source code :).</p>
<p>Major functions list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infrastructure for communicating with printer by means of IEEE 1284.4 protocol (initializing, opening/closing
channels, service discovery, data transmission and so on).</li>
<li>Read from arbitary EEPROM address for supported printers.</li>
<li>Write to arbitary EEPROM address for supported printers.</li>
<li>Get ink levels for every EPSON Stylus printer I think (almost "copied" from escputil).</li>
<li>Reset ink levels for supported printers.</li>
<li> Reset waste ink counter for supported printers.</li>
<li><strong>Can make test reports, containing information about printer</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Supported printers:</p>
<ul>
<li>EPSON Stylus Photo 790
<li>EPSON Stylus Color 580
<li>EPSON Stylus Photo 1290
<li>EPSON Stylus Color 680
<li>EPSON Stylus Photo T50
<li>EPSON Stylus Photo P50
</ul>
<p>Note that program written in the "wide" way, so it's easy to adjust it to work with
other printers. Just try. :) </p>
<p><strong>If you are not a developer, but want your Epson printer become supported, 
look <a href="report.html">here</a>.</strong></p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>Run the program without arguments. :)</p>
<p>In most cases you should power-off and then power-on printer after reseting ink level. This will allow printer 
to save new data in the cartridges.</p>

<h2>Download</h2>
<p>The program redistributes as a source tarball, which can be downloaded from
<a href="https://github.com/lion-simba/reink/releases">GitHub</a>. Run "make" to compile.</p>
